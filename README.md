# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

## Setup

Create a new builder.io project. 

Click on ["Models"](https://builder.io/models) and then create a new "Section", with some fields "title", "slug" and "draft". Name it "blog-article".

Then click on ["Content"](https://builder.io/content) and create some new blog article content, making sure to publish them when done.

If you head over to your [settings](https://builder.io/account/space) you can view your public API key which should be stored in your `.env`.

Set up `.env`

```bash
BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
BUILDER_BLOGPOST_MODEL='blog-article'
```


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
