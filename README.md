# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

## Setup

First clone the repo and run `npm install`.

Note: I am using node version `v18.17.0` locally. (verified by using: `node --version`)

Create a new builder.io project. 

Click on ["Models"](https://builder.io/models) and then create a new "Section".


![model](./docs/images/create-model-section.PNG)

Name it "blog-article", with any description.

![blog-article-model](./docs/images/new-blog-article-model.PNG)

Connect it up to your builder preview url (the astro site, typically this would be running on `http://localhost:4321/builder-preview`). Then click on save.

![add-preview-url](./docs/images/add-preview-url.PNG).

Add in the following fields "title", "slug" and "draft". 

![title-field](./docs/images/title-field.PNG)

![slug-field](./docs/images/slug-field.PNG)

![draft-field](./docs/images/draft-field.PNG)

After you added these fields, click "Save".

At this point we should start the astro site: `npm run dev`. This will allow us to preview the blog content in the editor.

Then click on ["Content"](https://builder.io/content) and create some new blog article content, making sure to publish them when done.

Fill out some blog content (Note: I don't even include my custom QWIK component yet the issue will still happen!)

Again remember to click on "Publish"!!!.

After you have published the changes, I noticed locally I need to restart my dev server so astro notices the new changes.

If you have done everything right you should see your blog at: `http://localhost:4321/blog/test`.

Lastly if you head over to your [settings](https://builder.io/account/space) you can view your public API key which should be stored in your `.env`.

Set up `.env`

```bash
BUILDER_API_PUBLIC_KEY=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
BUILDER_BLOGPOST_MODEL='blog-article'
```

Note: locally this all works fine, it's when we try to deploy to vercel where things break. 

I am using vercel CLI: `34.2.3` (verified by using `vercel --version`).

Deploy it to vercel using the `vercel` command.
You will notice a build error!


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
